    <h1>Hidden Harms Mapping: A Tool for Local Authorities</h1>

    <p class="intro-paragraph">
        The Harms Mapping Portal, developed by researchers at the <strong>University of Birmingham</strong>, provides
        local councils, police forces, and third-sector partners with a robust methodology for mapping hidden harms at
        a local level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our work, supported by a <strong>UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship</strong>,
        translates frontline professional expertise into actionable, strategic insight.
    </p>

    <h2>The Methodology: Secure Insight Through Comparative Judgement</h2>

    <p>
        Our platform operates on <strong>Comparative Judgement (CJ)</strong>, an advanced "<strong>wisdom of the
        crowd</strong>" technique.
    </p>

    <p>The process is designed to be both intuitive and secure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> We present frontline safeguarding professionals with pairs of localities (e.g.,
            wards) within their authority.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Judgement:</strong> They are asked a simple question: "Which of these two areas experiences a higher
            rate of a specific hidden harm?"
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> This comparative method is often more reliable than estimating absolute risk for
            a single area.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Crucially, this approach allows professionals to contribute their invaluable <strong>local expertise and
        professional insight</strong> without compromising confidentiality.
    </p>

    <p>No identifying individual case information, or even a specific number of cases, is required to participate.</p>

    <h2>Demonstrating Real-World Impact</h2>

    <p>
        We have successfully partnered with numerous local authorities and police forces to map a variety of complex
        harms, including <strong>forced marriage, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse, and honour-based abuse</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Case Study: Forced Marriage in Nottinghamshire</h3>

    <p>
        Our team collaborated with the Nottinghamshire Modern Slavery Partnership to map the risk of forced marriage
        across the county.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Process:</strong> We collected over 1,800 comparative judgments from 12 local experts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> This analysis successfully identified high-risk areas. In response to partner
            feedback, we developed and delivered a <strong>Continuing Professional Development (CPD) course</strong> based
            on these findings to over 130 local authority staff, embedding the insights directly into frontline practice.

    <h3>Case Study: Mapping Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in South Yorkshire</h3>

    <p>
        In partnership with the <strong>South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Honour Based Abuse Unit</strong>, our team
        conducted a focused study to map the risk of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) across the region.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Process:</strong> Over a dedicated three-week period in November and December 2022, we collected
            <strong>877 comparative judgements</strong> from <strong>18 specialist participants</strong>, including police
            and expert safeguarding professionals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> The insights generated from this mapping provided a critical new evidence base for
            South Yorkshire Police. The significance of this work was demonstrated at a national policy level; as a direct
            result of our findings, <strong>two formal questions regarding Honour-Based Abuse were tabled in the House of
            Commons</strong>, addressed to the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,
            respectively.
        </li>

    <h3>Case Study: Domestic Abuse Strategy in Wokingham</h3>

    <p>
        In partnership with Wokingham Borough Council and their domestic abuse partnership group, we conducted a study
        to map domestic abuse at the ward level.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Process:</strong> Local professionals provided judgements on domestic abuse prevalence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> The resulting analysis provided a clear visualisation of <strong>hotspot
            areas</strong>, which directly informed the council's ongoing domestic abuse strategy and resource
            allocation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Underpinning Science</h2>

    <p>Our methodology is built on a rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific foundation.</p>

    <p>
        The team is actively developing a novel statistical method known as the <strong>Bayesian Spatial Bradley-Terry
        model</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This model innovatively combines the pairwise comparisons from the Comparative Judgement process with spatial
        information to produce highly accurate and reliable harm maps.
    </p>
